# Vector - R is called as Vectorized language.
# Array - n-dimension collection of similar elements
# Matrix - subset of array (2 dimension array). Matrix generally contains numeric values.
# Vectorized form is used by R for calculation. (used in solving Linear regression)

v = c(1,2,3,4,5) # c - combine. Combine these values as a vector.
s = v*2
s

# A vector is collection of elements, all of same type.
# A vector cannot be of mixed type.

# Vector Operation
d = v-2
d
f = v /2
f
sqrt(f)

# This is more useful when dealing with dataset
